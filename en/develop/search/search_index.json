Here is an example:</p> Pair Stoploss Win Rate Risk Reward Ratio Expectancy XZC/ETH -0.01 0.50 1.176384 0.088 XZC/ETH -0.02 0.51 1.115941 0.079 XZC/ETH -0.03 0.52 1.359670 0.228 XZC/ETH -0.04 0.51 1.234539 0.117 <p>The goal here is to find the best stoploss for the strategy in order to have the maximum expectancy.

Defaults to <code>false</code>. Datatype: Boolean <code>process_throttle_secs</code> How often should Edge run in seconds. Defaults to <code>3600</code> (once per hour). Datatype: Integer <code>calculate_since_number_of_days</code> Number of days of data against which Edge calculates Win Rate, Risk Reward and Expectancy.  Note that it downloads historical data so increasing this number would lead to slowing down the bot. Defaults to <code>7</code>. Datatype: Integer <code>allowed_risk</code> Ratio of allowed risk per trade. Defaults to <code>0.01</code> (1%)). Datatype: Float <code>stoploss_range_min</code> Minimum stoploss. Defaults to <code>-0.01</code>. Datatype: Float <code>stoploss_range_max</code> Maximum stoploss. Defaults to <code>-0.10</code>. Datatype: Float <code>stoploss_range_step</code> As an example if this is set to -0.01 then Edge will test the strategy for <code>[-0.01, -0,02, -0,03 ..., -0.09, -0.10]</code> ranges.  Note than having a smaller step means having a bigger range which could lead to slow calculation.  If you set this parameter to -0.001, you then slow down the Edge calculation by a factor of 10. Defaults to <code>-0.001</code>. Datatype: Float <code>minimum_winrate</code> It filters out pairs which don't have at least minimum_winrate. This comes handy if you want to be conservative and don't comprise win rate in favour of risk reward ratio. Defaults to <code>0.60</code>. Datatype: Float <code>minimum_expectancy</code> It filters out pairs which have the expectancy lower than this number. Having an expectancy of 0.20 means if you put 10$ on a trade you expect a 12$ return. Defaults to <code>0.20</code>. Datatype: Float <code>min_trade_number</code> When calculating W, R and E (expectancy) against historical data, you always want to have a minimum number of trades. The more this number is the more Edge is reliable. Having a win rate of 100% on a single trade doesn't mean anything at all. But having a win rate of 70% over past 100 trades means clearly something. Defaults to <code>10</code> (it is highly recommended not to decrease this number). Datatype: Integer <code>max_trade_duration_minute</code> Edge will filter out trades with long duration. If a trade is profitable after 1 month, it is hard to evaluate the strategy based on it. But if most of trades are profitable and they have maximum duration of 30 minutes, then it is clearly a good sign.NOTICE: While configuring this value, you should take into consideration your timeframe. As an example filtering out trades having duration less than one day for a strategy which has 4h interval does not make sense. Default value is set assuming your strategy interval is relatively small (1m or 5m, etc.).Defaults to <code>1440</code> (one day). Datatype: Integer <code>remove_pumps</code> Edge will remove sudden pumps in a given market while going through historical data. However, given that pumps happen very often in crypto markets, we recommend you keep this off.Defaults to <code>false</code>.

Use the Hyperliquid API generator to create a separate API wallet.</li> <li>Don't store your actual wallet private key on the server you use for freqtrade. Use the API wallet private key instead. This key won't allow withdrawals, only trading.</li> <li>Always keep your mnemonic phrase and private key private.</li> <li>Don't use the same mnemonic as the one you had to backup when initializing a hardware wallet, using the same mnemonic basically deletes the security of your hardware wallet.</li> <li>Create a different software wallet, only transfer the funds you want to trade with to that wallet, and use that wallet to trade on Hyperliquid.</li> <li>If you have funds you don't want to use for trading (after making a profit for example), transfer them back to your hardware wallet.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"exchanges/#all-exchanges","title":"All exchanges","text":"<p>Should you experience constant errors with Nonce (like <code>InvalidNonce</code>), it is best to regenerate the API keys.

For example, to predict the close price 40 candles into the future, you would set <code>df['&amp;-s_close'] = df['close'].shift(-self.freqai_info[\"feature_parameters\"][\"label_period_candles\"])</code> with <code>\"label_period_candles\": 40</code> in the config. FreqAI makes the predictions and gives them back under the same key (<code>df['&amp;-s_close']</code>) to be used in <code>populate_entry/exit_trend()</code>.  Datatype: Depends on the output of the model. <code>df['&amp;*_std/mean']</code> Standard deviation and mean values of the defined labels during training (or live tracking with <code>fit_live_predictions_candles</code>). Commonly used to understand the rarity of a prediction (use the z-score as shown in <code>templates/FreqaiExampleStrategy.py</code> and explained here to evaluate how often a particular prediction was observed during training or historically with <code>fit_live_predictions_candles</code>).  Datatype: Float. <code>df['do_predict']</code> Indication of an outlier data point. The return value is integer between -2 and 2, which lets you know if the prediction is trustworthy or not. <code>do_predict==1</code> means that the prediction is trustworthy. If the Dissimilarity Index (DI, see details here) of the input data point is above the threshold defined in the config, FreqAI will subtract 1 from <code>do_predict</code>, resulting in <code>do_predict==0</code>. If <code>use_SVM_to_remove_outliers</code> is active, the Support Vector Machine (SVM, see details here) may also detect outliers in training and prediction data. In this case, the SVM will also subtract 1 from <code>do_predict</code>. If the input data point was considered an outlier by the SVM but not by the DI, or vice versa, the result will be <code>do_predict==0</code>. If both the DI and the SVM considers the input data point to be an outlier, the result will be <code>do_predict==-1</code>. As with the SVM, if <code>use_DBSCAN_to_remove_outliers</code> is active, DBSCAN (see details here) may also detect outliers and subtract 1 from <code>do_predict</code>. Hence, if both the SVM and DBSCAN are active and identify a datapoint that was above the DI threshold as an outlier, the result will be <code>do_predict==-2</code>. A particular case is when <code>do_predict == 2</code>, which means that the model has expired due to exceeding <code>expired_hours</code>.  Datatype: Integer between -2 and 2. <code>df['DI_values']</code> Dissimilarity Index (DI) values are proxies for the level of confidence FreqAI has in the prediction. A lower DI means the prediction is close to the training data, i.e., higher prediction confidence. See details about the DI here.  Datatype: Float. <code>df['%*']</code> Any dataframe column prepended with <code>%</code> in <code>feature_engineering_*()</code> is treated as a training feature. For example, you can include the RSI in the training feature set (similar to in <code>templates/FreqaiExampleStrategy.py</code>) by setting <code>df['%-rsi']</code>. See more details on how this is done here.  Note: Since the number of features prepended with <code>%</code> can multiply very quickly (10s of thousands of features are easily engineered using the multiplictative functionality of, e.g., <code>include_shifted_candles</code> and <code>include_timeframes</code> as described in the parameter table), these features are removed from the dataframe that is returned from FreqAI to the strategy. To keep a particular type of feature for plotting purposes, you would prepend it with <code>%%</code> (see details below).  Datatype: Depends on the feature created by the user. <code>df['%%*']</code> Any dataframe column prepended with <code>%%</code> in <code>feature_engineering_*()</code> is treated as a training feature, just the same as the above <code>%</code> prepend. However, in this case, the features are returned back to the strategy for FreqUI/plot-dataframe plotting and monitoring in Dry/Live/Backtesting  Datatype: Depends on the feature created by the user. Please note that features created in <code>feature_engineering_expand()</code> will have automatic FreqAI naming schemas depending on the expansions that you configured (i.e. <code>include_timeframes</code>, <code>include_corr_pairlist</code>, <code>indicators_periods_candles</code>, <code>include_shifted_candles</code>). So if you want to plot <code>%%-rsi</code> from <code>feature_engineering_expand_all()</code>, the final naming scheme for your plotting config would be: <code>%%-rsi-period_10_ETH/USDT:USDT_1h</code> for the <code>rsi</code> feature with <code>period=10</code>, <code>timeframe=1h</code>, and <code>pair=ETH/USDT:USDT</code> (the <code>:USDT</code> is added if you are using futures pairs).

The reward is used to train weights in a neural network.</p> <p>A second important component of the FreqAI RL implementation is the use of state information.

Not only this, but you can help improve the continuity of your rewards/penalties by having them scale with severity according to some linear/exponential functions.

Fortunately, a recent maturation of robust machine learning libraries (e.g. <code>scikit-learn</code>) has opened up a wide range of research possibilities. Scientists from a diverse range of fields can now easily prototype their studies on an abundance of established machine learning algorithms. Similarly, these user-friendly libraries enable \"citzen scientists\" to use their basic Python skills for data exploration. However, leveraging these machine learning libraries on historical and live chaotic data sources can be logistically difficult and expensive. Additionally, robust data collection, storage, and handling presents a disparate challenge. <code>FreqAI</code> aims to provide a generalized and extensible open-sourced framework geared toward live deployments of adaptive modeling for market forecasting. The <code>FreqAI</code> framework is effectively a sandbox for the rich world of open-source machine learning libraries. Inside the <code>FreqAI</code> sandbox, users find they can combine a wide variety of third-party libraries to test creative hypotheses on a free live 24/7 chaotic data source - cryptocurrency exchange data. </p>"},{"location":"freqai/#citing-freqai","title":"Citing FreqAI","text":"<p>FreqAI is published in the Journal of Open Source Software.

In backtesting, the bot will get full data of the pairs according to the timerange specified. But in a dry/live run, the bot will be limited by the amount of data each exchanges gives.</p> <p>For example, to calculate a very basic indicator called <code>steps</code>, the first row's value is always 0, while the following rows' values are equal to the value of the previous row plus 1.

Then instead of 999, the <code>steps</code> value at last closed candle is 499. The difference of the value means your backtest result can differ from your dry/live run result.</p> <p>The <code>recursive-analysis</code> command requires historic data to be available. To learn how to get data for the pairs and exchange you're interested in, head over to the Data Downloading section of the documentation.</p> <p>This command is built upon preparing different lengths of data and calculates indicators based on them. This does not backtest the strategy itself, but rather only calculates the indicators.

Since we are only looking at indicator values, using more than one pair is redundant. Preferably use a pair with a relatively high price and at least moderate volatility, such as BTC or ETH, to avoid rounding issues that can make the results inaccurate. If no pair is set on the command, the pair used for this analysis is the first pair in the whitelist.</li> <li>It is recommended to set a long timerange (at least 5000 candles) so that the initial indicators' calculation that is going to be used as a benchmark has very small or no recursive issues itself. For example, for a 5m timeframe, a timerange of 5000 candles would be equal to 18 days.</li> <li><code>--cache</code> is forced to \"none\" to avoid loading previous indicators calculation automatically.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to the recursive formula check, this command also carries out a simple lookahead bias check on the indicator values only.

Strategies that look into the future will perform well during backtesting, often with incredible profits or winrates, but will fail or perform badly in real conditions.</p> <p>The following list contains some common patterns which should be avoided to prevent frustration:</p> <ul> <li>don't use <code>shift(-1)</code> or other negative values. This uses data from the future in backtesting, which is not available in dry or live modes.</li> <li>don't use <code>.iloc[-1]</code> or any other absolute position in the dataframe within <code>populate_</code> functions, as this will be different between dry-run and backtesting. Absolute <code>iloc</code> indexing is safe to use in callbacks however - see Strategy Callbacks.</li> <li>don't use functions that use all dataframe or column values, e.g. <code>dataframe['mean_volume'] = dataframe['volume'].mean()</code>. As backtesting uses the full dataframe, at any point in the dataframe, the <code>'mean_volume'</code> series would include data from the future. Use rolling() calculations instead, e.g. <code>dataframe['volume'].rolling(&lt;window&gt;).mean()</code>.</li> <li>don't use <code>.resample('1h')</code>. This uses the left border of the period interval, so moves data from an hour boundary to the start of the hour. Use <code>.resample('1h', label='right')</code> instead.</li> </ul> <p>Identifying problems</p> <p>You should always use the two helper commands lookahead-analysis and recursive-analysis, which can each help you figure out problems with your strategy in different ways.
